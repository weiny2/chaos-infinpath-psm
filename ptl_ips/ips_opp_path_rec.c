   * High Priority Path
   * ------------------
   * 
   * Uses the "base" Service ID. For now there exists only 1 high priority
   * path between nodes even for non zero LMC fabrics. 
   * TODO: Investigate if there are any benefits for using multiple high 
   * priority paths. Initial empirical data shows that this leads to worse
   * performance as the bulk data can induce HOL blocking.
   * Currently the normal and low priority paths are same but at some point
   * we can create separate vFabrics to further distinguish/isolate those 
   * traffic flows.
   *
   * Normal/Low Priority Paths
   * -------------------------
   * 
   * Currently these paths are the same i.e. they are queried for the same
   * Service ID/vFabric which is the Base Service ID for High Priority + 1.
   * 
   * Use case Scenarios
   * ------------------
   *
   * Since with vFabrics we have the capability to define different QoS 
   * parameters per vFabric it is envisioned that the IPS_PATH_HIGH_PRIORITY is
   * setup in a separate vFabric for high priority traffic. The NORMAL paths
   * are setup in a separate vFabric optimized for high bandwidth. This allows
   * us to potentially have control traffic (RTS, CTS etc.) not be bottlenecked
   * by bulk transfer data. All control messages (ACKs,NAKs, TID_GRANT etc.)
   * also use the high priority control vFabric.
   *
   * NOTE: In order to distinguish between the different vFabrics the user
   * specifies the service ID to use via mpirun (or environment variable). 
   * This is the service ID for the high priority control traffic. The bulk
   * data vFabric is identified by service ID + 1. So for each MPI application
   * one should specify two service IDs for the high priority and bulk data.
   * Both these service IDs can be placed in the same vFabric which can be
   * configured for high priority or bandwidth traffic giving us the default
   * behavior upto Infinipath 2.5 release.
   *
   * NOTE: All of the above would have really helped if the S20 silicon could
   * correctly support IBTA QoS features. Due to S20 design we can only have
   * high priority VLarb table (low priority VLarb table results in round
   * robin arbitration ignoring the weights!). But if this is fixed in a 
   * subsequent chip respin then this may potentially help our scalability
   * on large fabrics.
   *
   * Mesh/Torus and DOR routed networks
   * ----------------------------------
   * 
   * In a mesh/torus fabric we always have a non zero LMC (atleast 1 can be 
   * more). We would like to take advantage of dispersive routing on these
   * fabrics as well to obtain better "worst case/congested" bandwidth. For
   * these networks currently the base LIDs are used for UPDN routing which 
   * is suboptimal on these networks. Higher order LIDs (+1 .. +N) use DOR
   * routing (Dimension Ordered Routing) to avoid deadlocks and provide
   * higher performance. If a fabric is disrupted then only the base UPDN
   * routing is available. PSM should continue to operate in this environment
   * albeit with degraded performance. In disrupted fabric the OPP path
   * record queries may fail for some DOR routed LIDs i.e. no path exists
   * PSM should hence ignore path record failures as they indicate a disrupted
   * fabric and only use valid paths that are returned from the replica. This
   * will degenerate to only using the UPDN paths on disrupted fabrics and DOR
   * routes only for fully configured fabrics. Note: For a clean fabric the
   * base LIDs that are configured for UPDN route will not exist in the replica
   * as DOR routes are preferred. Hence we will only dispersively route across
   * the DOR routes only using the UPDN route for disrupted fabrics.
   *
   * AS LONG AS ONE PATH EXISTS (for each of the priorities) COMMUNICATION CAN
   * TAKE PLACE.
