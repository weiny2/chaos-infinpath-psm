================================================================================

OFED Support
------------
OFED 1.5.1rc2 or above should be installed on the node. Prior versions of OFED
have an older QLogic IB driver (ib_qib) and do not fully support all the PSM
features with this release.

Building PSM
------------
Build requires that GNU GCC compiler is installed on 
the machine doing the build. Root privileges are required to install the
runtime libraries and development header files into standard system location.
There are two mechanisms for building PSM:
  1. Use provided Makefiles to build and install
  2. Generate a tarball that can be used to build source and binary RPMs

The instructions below use $PRODUCT and $RELEASE to refer to the product
and release identifiers of the infinipath-psm RPM.

Building from Makefiles
-----------------------
1. Untar the tarball:
	$ tar zxvf infinipath-psm-$PRODUCT-$RELEASE.tar.gz
2. Change directory into the untarred location:
	$ cd infinipath-psm-$PRODUCT-$RELEASE
3. Run make on the command line. This will build the libraries. By default,
   the Makefile will auto-detect whether libuuid and the uuid.h header file
   are installed. If so, it will use the system's libuuid. Otherwise, PSM
   will be compiled with the libuuid included with PSM.
	$ make
   To force compiling with the included libuuid, use the USE_PSM_UUID variable:
        $ make USE_PSM_UUID=1
4. Install the libraries and header files on the system (as root):
	$ make install

The libraries will be installed in either /usr/lib or /usr/lib64, depending on
the architecture of the machine, and the header files will be installed in 
/usr/include.
This behavior can be altered by using the "DESTDIR" and "LIBDIR" variables on
the "make install" command line. "DESTDIR" will add a leading path component
to the overall install path and "LIBDIR" will change the path where libraries
will be installed. For example, "make DESTDIR=/tmp/psm-install install" will
install all files (libraries and headers) into "/tmp/psm-install/usr/...",
"make DESTDIR=/tmp/psm-install LIBDIR=/libraries install" will install the
libraries in "/tmp/psm-install/libraries" and the headers in
"/tmp/psm-install/usr/include", and "make LIBDIR=/tmp/libs install" will
install the libraries in "/tmp/libs" and the headers in "/usr/include".

Generating PSM source and binary RPMs
--------------------------------------
This is a two step process: Generate a PSM distribution tarball which can then
be used to generate source and binary RPMs using the rpmbuild command with the
-ta option.
1. Untar the tarball:
	$ tar zxvf infinipath-psm-$PRODUCT-$RELEASE.tar.gz
2. Change directory into the untarred location:
	$ cd infinipath-psm-$PRODUCT-$RELEASE
3. Generate distribution tarball
   	$ make dist
   To force compiling with the included libuuid, use the USE_PSM_UUID variable:
        $ make dist USE_PSM_UUID=1
   Note: It is recommended if you are planning on doing cross distribution
builds to use the included libuuid i.e. If you are generating the distribution
tarball on a RHEL machine but may use rpmbuild on a SuSE SLES machine. This
minimized any cross distribution dependencies for the package.
4. Generate source and binary packages
   	$ rpmbuild -ta infinipath-psm-$PRODUCT-$RELEASE.tar.gz
   Please refere to the man page of rpmbuild for other options in generating
RPMs. The generated RPMs are relocatable so one can provide the prefix option
to retarget the installation location.

If you run into any issues during build please post any questions with as much 
information as possible to the psm-devel mailing list. Please include the 
distribution you are building on, the compiler type and version as well as any 
relevant error messages.

MPI Libraries supported
-----------------------
A large number of open source (OpenMPI, MVAPICH, MVAPICH2) and Vendor MPI
implementations support PSM for optimized communication on QLogic Truescale
Infiniband HCAs. Vendor MPI implementations (HP-MPI, Intel MPI 4.0 with PMI,
Platform/Scali MPI) require that the PSM runtime libraries be installed and
available on each node. Usually a configuration file or a command line switch
to mpirun needs to be specified to utilize the PSM transport.

OpenMPI support
---------------
It is recommended to use the OpenMPI v1.5 development branch. Prior versions
of OpenMPI have an issue with support PSM network transports mixed with standard
Verbs transport (BTL openib). This prevents an OpenMPI installation with
network modules available for PSM and Verbs to work correctly on nodes with
no QLogic IB hardware. This has been fixed in the latest development branch
allowing a single OpenMPI installation to target IB hardware via PSM or Verbs
as well as alternate transports seamlessly.

PSM header and runtime files need to be installed on a node where the OpenMPI
build is performed. All compute nodes additionally should have the PSM runtime
libraries available on them. OpenMPI provides a standard configure, make and
make install mechanism which will detect and build the relevant PSM network
modules for OpenMPI once the header and runtime files are detected. Further
information on compiling and running MPI applications with OpenMPI on PSM is
available in the QLogic OFED User guide available at:

http://driverdownloads.qlogic.com/QLogicDriverDownloads_UI/SearchByProduct.aspx?ProductCategory=301&Product=1116&Os=65

MVAPICH and MVAPICH2 support
----------------------------
Both MVAPICH and MVAPICH2 support PSM transport for optimized communication on
QLogic Truescale IB hardware. MVAPICH2 1.4 and MVAPICH 1.2 versions are
recommended. PSM header and runtime files need to be installed on a node where 
MVAPICH builds are performed. All compute nodes additionally should have the 
PSM runtime libraries available on them.

MVAPICH provides a shell script in it's top level directory called
make.mvapich.psm to configur, make and install MVAPICH with PSM support.

MVAPICH2 provides a standard configure and make infrastructure. In order to
MVAPICH2 for PSM the following should be performed from the top level directory:

    - ./configure --prefix=<path_to_install_mvapich2> --with-device=ch3:psm
    - make
    - make install

Further information on compiling and running MPI applications with MVAPICH on 
PSM is available in the QLogic OFED User guide available at:
